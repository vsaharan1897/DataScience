# Problem 3.32b. 
#Modify the Balls.R script to simulate the distribution of 700 red blood cells on a hemocytometer slide. Use your simulation to estimate the probability that a square contains between 3 and 6 cells. 
```{r}
n <- 700   
u <- 160 
lambda = n/u
bowls <- rep(0,u)  
for (i in 1:n)
{
    i <- sample(1:u,1)  
    bowls[i] <- bowls[i] + 1   
}
bowls  
table(bowls)  
round(dpois(0:max(bowls),lambda)*u,2)
print ("P between 3 and 6 cells simulate")
sum(table(bowls)[3:6]) /160
print ("P between 3 and 6 based on Poisson mode")
```


# Problem 3.43
#Choose your favorite value of lamba and let X~ Pois(lambda). Simulate the probability that X is odd. 
```{r}
n <- 500   
u <- 100  
lambda = n/u
bowls <- rep(0,u)  
for (i in 1:n)
{
    i <- sample(1:u,1) 
    bowls[i] <- bowls[i] + 1 
}
table(bowls)  
sum(bowls%%2==1) /u
sum(bowls%%2==0) /u
odds <- 1:round(max(bowls)/2)*2-1
sum(round(dpois(0:max(bowls),lambda)*u,2)[odds])/100
value <- (1 - exp(-2*lambda)) / 2
value
